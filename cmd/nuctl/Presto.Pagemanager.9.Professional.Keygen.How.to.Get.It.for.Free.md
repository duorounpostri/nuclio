After the trial period expires, you can either buy the license or uninstall the software. If you like the software and want to keep using it, buying the license is the best option. You will get updates, support, and security from the developer. You will also avoid any legal or ethical issues that might arise from using a keygen.
 
So don't waste your time and risk your safety by looking for a keygen online. Download Presto Pagemanager 9 Professional from the official website and enjoy its benefits for free for 30 days.
