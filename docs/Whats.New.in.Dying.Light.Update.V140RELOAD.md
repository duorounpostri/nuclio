## How to Play Dying Light Like a Pro
 
Dying Light is not just a game about killing zombies. It's also a game about parkour, crafting, exploration, and survival. If you want to play Dying Light like a pro, you need to master these aspects and use them to your advantage. Here are some tips and tricks that will help you do that:

- Aim for the head. The infected go down quickly if you land headshots time and time again. You can also use firearms or bows to shoot their heads from a distance, but be careful of the noise and ammo consumption.
- Stay off the street. As Spike warns you during the prologue, stay off the street! The street is full of zombies and other dangers, and you are vulnerable on the ground. Use your parkour skills to traverse on rooftops, walls, poles, and other structures. You will be faster, safer, and more agile.
- Get non-weapon attacks in the power skill tree. Sometimes, you will run out of weapons or durability, or you will face enemies that are immune to your attacks. In these cases, you need to rely on your non-weapon attacks, such as dropkick, stomp, grapple, tackle, and throw. These attacks can be very effective and fun to use.
- Always have medkits and lockpicks. Medkits are essential for healing yourself and your allies. Lockpicks are essential for opening locked chests and doors that contain valuable loot. You can craft both of these items using common materials that you can find or buy.
- Don't drop old weapons. Old weapons may seem useless when you find better ones, but they can still serve a purpose. You can sell them for money, dismantle them for metal parts, or use them as throwables. You can also upgrade them with blueprints or mods to make them more powerful.
- Secure safe zones. Safe zones are places where you can rest, stash your items, access your stash, change your outfit, and interact with other survivors. They also protect you from the night and the volatile zombies that come out then. You can secure safe zones by clearing them of enemies and turning on the power.
- Stockpile coffee. Coffee is a common item that you can find or buy in Dying Light. It may seem useless at first, but it has a hidden value. You can trade coffee for survivor points at the quartermaster in the Tower or other safe zones. Survivor points are used to level up your survivor rank and unlock new skills.
- Loot vehicles. Vehicles are another common source of loot in Dying Light. You can loot their trunks, hoods, or glove compartments for money, weapons, ammo, or crafting materials. Some vehicles may be locked or alarmed, so be careful when looting them.

These are just some of the tips and tricks that will help you play Dying Light like a pro. There are many more secrets and strategies to discover in this game, so keep playing and have fun!
